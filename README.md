# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Keras. The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, achieving an accuracy of 98.7%. The system is designed to classify handwritten digits from images with high precision.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for model development and data handling.
- **Keras:** Deep learning framework for building and training the ANN.
- **MNIST Dataset:** A benchmark dataset used for training and evaluating the model.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ymadhumohanreddy/ML-and-DL-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ML-and-DL-projects/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-on-MNIST-Dataset
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python installed, then use pip to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the following command to train the model and evaluate its performance:

   ```bash
   python handwritten_digit_recognition.py
   ```

2. **Results:**

   The script will output the model’s accuracy on the MNIST test set and display some sample predictions.

## Code Example

Here’s a basic overview of the code in `handwritten_digit_recognition.py`:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.utils import np_utils

# Load dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 28 * 28).astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 28 * 28).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = np_utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Define model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(512, input_dim=784, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=200, verbose=2)

# Evaluate model
scores = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Accuracy: {scores[1]*100:.2f}%")
```
